# BMI Calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
This project is a simple implementation of a Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of the project is to showcase the author's understanding of these technologies and their ability to create a responsive and interactive web application.

#vGetting Started
To get started with this project, you can clone the repository to your local machine:


git clone https://github.com/{username}/{repository_name}.git
Once you have the code on your machine, you can open the index.html file in your web browser to use the calculator.

# Usage
The calculator allows the user to enter their height and weight, and calculates their BMI based on those values. The user can select either metric (kg/m) or imperial (lb/in) units for their input.

The calculator is designed to be responsive, so it can be used on a variety of devices, from desktop computers to mobile phones.

# Customization
If you want to customize the calculator, you can modify the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to suit your needs. You can change the styling, adjust the calculation formula, or add additional features such as a recommended weight range.
